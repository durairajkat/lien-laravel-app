                    or text of lien laws statutes and laws, the calculations,
                    the database of statutes and laws and the reports that are created may become out-of-date over time
                    since new statutes and laws may have been published and
                    become generally-accepted after Lien Store, LLC d/b/a Construction Lien Manager&trade; online
                    database was developed or after trials by our subscribers new
                    reports are required or may be adjusted. In addition, statutes and laws included in the Lien Store,
                    LLC d/b/a Construction Lien Manager&trade; online

                    legislation, business skills and trials by our subscribers may
                    generate new modifications to the program. In using the The Construction Lien Manager &trade;,
