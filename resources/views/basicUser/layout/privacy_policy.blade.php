                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">1. Privacy Policies</p>
                <p>Our members will adopt a privacy policy that is easy for businesses to find, read, and understand.
                    Our privacy policies will -- </p>
                <p>A. Provide users, subscriber, member or recipients (&ldquo;user&rdquo;) with reasonable notice of our
                    information practices, including disclosure of-- </p>
                <p>1. collection or use of any information about the user; </p>
                <p>2. collection or use of aggregate data; and </p>
                <p>3. what, if any, access to private business information collected on our Web site we provide to un
                    third parties. </p>
                <p>B. Provide businesses with a meaningful choice on our Web site to accept or decline our proposed
                    collection and use of private business information provided by the business including, if any,
                    consent to the transfer of information to third parties. </p>
                <p>C. Contain a positive commitment from us to use security procedures to protect private business
                    information we collect from misuse. </p>
                <p>D. Provide, where appropriate, procedures for businesses to review and correct their private business
                    information that we maintain, or to request that we delete the information, and include a
                    description of the effect of any changes on other information about the user that we maintain. </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">2. Enhanced Privacy Protection for Private Business Information </p>
                <p>A. If we collect private business information, we will only use it for the purposes for which a
                    reasonable business would expect us to use it or as agreed to by the business. </p>
                <p>B. We will not disclose private business information to an un third party and/or for un purposes
                    without first obtaining the consent of the business (by means of an explicit &quot;opt-in&quot;
                    procedure). </p>
                <p>C. When we make significant changes to our privacy policies that affect the use of the private
                    business information we collect, we will give notice to our users. We will not make use of
                    information we gathered from individuals prior to a significant change in policy without first
                    obtaining their consent for any new uses. We may also make non-significant changes to our privacy
                    policies that will not affect our use of a business's private business information. We will post
                    such changes on our Web site. </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">3. Safeguarding Business Privacy in Relationships with Third Parties </p>
                <p>A. Where third parties have access to private business information from our site, our agreements with
                    these third parties will follow these principles in giving businesses notice and choice with respect
                    to that third party's access and use. </p>
                <p>B. Where we have relationships with third parties, we will adopt procedures to tell businesses if
                    third parties have access to private business information about them from our site. </p>
                <p>C. We will take appropriate precautions to prevent inadvertent disclosures of private business
                    information to third parties and will take immediate steps to eliminate such disclosures, if they
                    occur, once they have come to our attention. </p>
                <p>D. We will not allow third parties any access to non- private business individual information
                    collected on our site unless the third party agrees that it will not use the information to identify
                    individuals. </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">4. Disclosure of Ownership and Financial Sponsorship </p>
                <p>We will disclose those who have major financial interests in us or the Web sites we operate, and
                    those who give us significant funding or other assistance. We will state who owns any Web site we
                    operate. </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">5. Identifying Advertising and Information Content Sponsored by Third
                    Parties </p>
                <p>A. We will clearly distinguish advertising from information content, using identifying words, design,
                    or placement. We will design our Web sites to avoid confusion between advertising and information
                    content. </p>
                <p>B. We will clearly disclose significant relationships between commercial sponsors and our information
                    content by identifying a sponsor's involvement in-- </p>
                <p>1. selecting or preparing information content that appears on our Web site, including any sponsorship
                    of priority listings in search engine results, product listings, or other preferences in
                    presentation of information to businesses; and </p>
                <p>2. any &quot;co-branding&quot; of information content or Internet services. </p>
                <p>C. We will provide businesses with a policy that is easy for businesses to find, read and understand
                    regarding our acceptance of advertising and of information content sponsored by others. Our policy
                    will disclose-- </p>
                <p>1. how we identify advertising and commercially sponsored information content on our Web site; </p>

                    based on business use of links to other Web sites, and revenues for transfer or use of information
                    about users, including aggregate data; </p>
                <p>3. whether we target advertising or sponsored information content to businesses based on information
                    about them or their use of our Web site; and </p>
                <p>4. whether we intend any links to other Web sites, logos, or marks of other companies, or any
                    co-branding to constitute recommendations to the business. </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">6. Promotional Offers, Rebates, and Free Items or Services </p>
                <p>We will comply with existing federal and state laws regarding any promotions, rebates, and free or
                    discounted offers on our Web sites. </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">7. Quality of Information Content </p>
                <p>A. We will not make claims of credit protection or other receivables benefit without reasonable
                    support, or deliberately provide false or misleading information. </p>
                <p>B. We will not accept advertising or sponsored information content that we know either contains false
                    or misleading claims or promotes ineffective or inaccurate services. </p>
                <p>C. We will have an editorial policy that is easy for businesses to find, read, and understand. Our
                    editorial policy will describe procedures we use for evaluating the quality of the information
                    content on our Web site, whether created by us or obtained from others. </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">8. Authorship and Accountability </p>
                <p>A. We will disclose any cases where we have placed information content on our Web site because of
                    sponsorship or other support from a third party. In addition to identifying the sponsor, we will
                    clearly disclose significant relationships between the commercial sponsor and our information
                    content by identifying the sponsor's involvement with that content. </p>
                <p>B. Where we reproduce information content created by third parties, we will clearly disclose the
                    author and/or source of the material and the date of the material or its last update. </p>
                <p>C. Where we present information content as the result of statutory or case law experience or legal
                    research, we will clearly disclose the actual author(s) of the information content. </p>
                <p>D. Where we create information content for use by businesses, we will provide businesses general
                    information about our authors and their qualifications, our editorial policy, and, if any, our

                <p>E. Where we create information content, we will clearly disclose the date it was created or last
                    updated. </p>
                <p>F. We will have a conflict of interest policy for all authors that is easy for businesses to find,
                    read, and understand. We will disclose all affiliations and financial relationships of authors
                    consistent with our policy. </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">9. Disclosure of Source and Validation for Self-Assessment Tools </p>
                <p>A. Where we offer self-assessment tools, we will disclose their source and appropriately describe the

                    evaluation process and the date of the last review or update. </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">10. Professionalism </p>
                <p>A. We believe that current codes of ethics apply when care professionals use Web sites to provide
                    professional care. However, these codes do not apply to every interaction between a business and a
                    professional. Our Web sites shall provide conspicuous and appropriate information for businesses to
                    understand when they are and are not in an interaction with a professional that is covered by the
                    ethical standards of the profession. </p>
                <p>B. Where we allow care professionals to engage in professional care on our Web sites, we will design
                    Internet services to enable care professionals to adhere to professional ethical principles in the
                    online environment. We will continue to evolve new standards of practice to meet the changing
                    expectations created by businesses' use of Internet services. </p>
                <p>C. Internet services directed to and for use by care professionals are beyond the scope of these
                    principles.</p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">11. Qualifications </p>
                <p>A. We will provide the credentials and qualifications of persons responsible for care services
                    delivered via our business Web sites. If applicable, we will also provide information about
                    professional licensure. </p>
                <p>B. We will disclose whether we verify information regarding care professionals or others who provide
                    services or information on our Web sites. </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">12. Transparency of Interactions, Candor and Trustworthiness </p>
                <p>A. We will inform businesses who use our Internet services of the risks, responsibilities, and
                    reasonable expectations associated with their use of our services. We will make sure that this
                    information is easy for businesses to find, read, and understand. </p>
                <p>B. We will strive to make it apparent to businesses when they move within a site, or leave one site
                    for another, and when the move changes the risks, responsibilities, and expectations associated with
                    their activities. </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">13. Disclosure of Limitations </p>
                <p>We will advise businesses of any limitations of our Web site as a source of care services. In
                    particular, we will state that online services and information content cannot replace a
                    professional-patient relationship, and that businesses should always consult with a professional for
                    diagnosis and treatment of their specific problems. </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; ">14. Mechanism for Business Feedback </p>
